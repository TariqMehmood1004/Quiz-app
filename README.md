# Notio Quizzee App

A new Flutter project.

## Main.dart file

The given code appears to be a Flutter application written in Dart programming language. Let me provide a brief overview of what this code does:

The main() function sets the system UI overlay style using SystemChrome.setSystemUIOverlayStyle(), which makes the status bar transparent. SystemUiOverlayStyle is a class in Flutter that allows you to customize the appearance of the system overlays, such as the status bar and the navigation bar.

The main() function then calls the runApp() function, which starts the Flutter application and passes an instance of MyApp as the root widget of the application.

MyApp is a stateless widget that serves as the entry point of the application. It contains a MaterialApp widget, which is a container for a Flutter Material Design application. The debugShowCheckedModeBanner property is set to false, which hides the "debug" banner on the top right corner of the screen in debug mode.

The home property of MaterialApp is set to a Scaffold widget, which provides a basic structure for a Material Design app. The body of the Scaffold contains a Stack widget that stacks two children widgets on top of each other: DrawerControllerScreen() and DashboardControllerScreen().

DrawerControllerScreen and DashboardControllerScreen are assumed to be custom widget classes representing the UI for a drawer and a dashboard screen respectively.

Note: It is worth mentioning that the code snippet provided is incomplete and might not be able to run standalone. It might require additional imports and implementation of DrawerControllerScreen and DashboardControllerScreen widgets.
